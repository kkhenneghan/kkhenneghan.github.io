	<p class="firstparagraph">We may, at our discretion, impose limits on the amount of money you can send or receive through the Venmo Services. Please see our Help Center here for more details on limits. If we have authenticated your identity, we may increase your sending and/or receiving limits. These limits may change from time to time in Companyâ€™s sole discretion. You may not send money to your own account.</p>
	<p class="secondparagraph">When your checking account is used as your funding source, you are requesting that we initiate on your behalf an electronic transfer from your bank account. For these transactions, Company will make electronic transfers (via the Automated Clearing House ("ACH") of NACHA - The Electronic Payment Association ("NACHA")) from your bank account in the amount you specify. You agree that such requests constitute your authorization to Company to make the ACH transfer, and once you have provided your authorization for the transfer, you will not be able to cancel the electronic transfer and Company may resubmit any ACH debit you authorized that is returned for insufficient or uncollected funds, except as otherwise provided by NACHA's ACH rules (collectively, the "ACH Rules"), or applicable law.</p> </div>
