	<h1></h1>
	<p class="firstparagraph">You do not need to maintain a balance in your account in order to make payments. If you do hold a balance, Company will hold your funds separate from its corporate funds, will not use your funds for its operating expenses or any other corporate purposes, and will not voluntarily make your funds available to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy. While your funds are in our custody, Company will combine your funds with the funds of other users and place those pooled accounts in one or more bank accounts in Company's name.</p>

	<p class="secondparagraph">Company is not a bank or other chartered depository institution. Funds held by Company or its service providers (including any bank service providers) in connection with the processing of transactions are not deposit obligations and are not insured for the benefit of the user by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency. Funds held in balance are an ancillary function of enabling money transmission and not for other benefit.</p> </div>
