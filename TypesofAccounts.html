	<p class="firstparagraph">Venmo offers two different types of accounts, personal and business accounts. You may have only one personal account. Personal accounts are for use in person-to-person transfers with friends and family, and other people whom you know, and for App Payments as described in this Agreement. Some features of personal accounts may be limited based on how you wish to use the Venmo Services, how much you need to send or spend and what we know about you. We may require that you provide more information in order to complete a transaction. Personal accounts may not be used to receive business, commercial or merchant transactions.
	</p>

	<p class="secondparagraph">For each business you are involved with, you may have only one business account. Business account use is limited. Business accounts must be applied for and explicitly authorized. By opening a business account and accepting the terms as outlined in this Agreement, including, but not limited to, the Rules and Restrictions for Business Accounts set forth below, you attest that neither you nor your business is establishing a business account primarily for personal, family or household purposes. We may reverse or place a hold on your transactions or place a reserve on your funds if you are in breach of this Agreement, including, but not limited to, if you are using a personal account for business purposes or a business account for personal, family or household purposes.</p>
