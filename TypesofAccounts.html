	<p class="firstparagraph">Venmo offers two different types of accounts, personal and business accounts. You may have only one personal account. Personal accounts are for use in person-to-person transfers with friends and family, and other people whom you know, and for App Payments as described in this Agreement. Some features of personal accounts may be limited based on how you wish to use the Venmo Services, how much you need to send or spend and what we know about you. We may require that you provide more information in order to complete a transaction. Personal accounts may not be used to receive business, commercial or merchant transactions.</p> </div>
